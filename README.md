## I tried to get as much done in the one week time frame as i could.
## There were some elements I did not have enough time to devote to:
### - logo animation (the twitching)
### - dropdown menu transition
### - dropdown mini menu itmes

##The website was built to be fully responsive from 640px to 3900px
##As I was working, I was comminting my changes to my github repository,
## so you may track my progress (as requested in directions).
